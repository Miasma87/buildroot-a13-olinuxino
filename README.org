* About
This BuildRoot repo is based on instructions from the Olimex [[https://www.olimex.com/wiki/Build_Bootable_SD_Card_with_Debian][wiki]].

It is for for my personal use.

* Instructions
I've just uploaded the source code that builds the image and I'm testing it right now.

Try this command to achive it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 make a13_olinuxino_defconfig
 make
#+END_SRC

At the end of the compilation process you will see instructions to create sd image.
